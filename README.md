# Caltrain

This is an application which helps users to easily lookup train schedules between stations.

Heroku Link: https://bayrails.herokuapp.com/

## Technologies used:
- Rails version 5.1.2
- Ruby version 2.4.0
- Clearance gem for managing User sessions
- Postgresql as the database
- Materialize for styling and CSS

## Existing Features:
- Users can view schedules for upcoming Caltrains by selecting the "From" and "To" dropdowns and providing the departure time.
- Once signed up a user can
    - Add a particular route(between two stations) to his favorites
    - Delete routes from his favorites
    - Set "from" and "to" dropdowns by clicking on stations on a map

## Planned Features:
- Integrate BART and Muni data as well
